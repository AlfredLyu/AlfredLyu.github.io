We introduced Virtual Community, an open-world simulation platform that unifies humans and robots in large-scale, realistic environments generated from real-world data and generative models. Based on this platform, we introduced new planning and robot collaboration challenges, and show that existing methods struggle in these complex social and physical open-world settings, highlighting the need for more advanced approaches and demonstrating the value of Virtual Community.
